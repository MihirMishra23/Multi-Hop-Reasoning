        "examples": "For example, for the sentence: 'James Clark is an Australian soccer player with a Austrian wife named Alissa Jordan' would have the triplets: (James Clark, nationality, Australian), (James Clark, occupation, soccer player), (James Clark, wife name, Alissa Jordan), (Alissa Jordan, husband, James Clark), (Alissa Jordan, nationality, Austrian).",
        "prompt": "Extract triplets from the following context. Each triplet must be of the form (entity, relationship, value). Rules: - Entities is the subject of a sentence. Do not use pronouns (e.g he, or it) to describe an entity, use the full descriptive name. - Relationships refer  to any characteristic of an entity. Even if a relationship is not explicity mentioned, you must included it. Relationships can be things that entity was involved in, or any descriptive characterisitc of that entity.If an entity is described with multiple characteristics in one go, create seperate triplet entries for each of those characteristics.Example: from the text 'Albert Einstein was a German theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity.' the triplets are (Albert Einstein, nationality, Germany), (Albert Einstein, occupation, theoretical physicist), (Albert Einstein, best known for, developping the theory of relativity) Given these examples, generate explicit and implicit triplets from the following context. \n\n {context}"
